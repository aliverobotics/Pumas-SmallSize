<H2>Competition Rules</H2></CENTER>
<H3>Overview</H3>
<P>2004 marks the second year that the BYU Robot Soccer competition will be a 
two-on-two competition. We'll adopt many of the <A 
href="http://www.ee.byu.edu/grad1/users/beard/www_docs/490/robot/2003/class/f180rules.pdf" 
target=_new>rules of the Robocup Smallsize (F-180) league</A>, particularly 
those for the size of robots and the field, and we'll try to be consistent with 
their style of play. Over time, the continuing improvements in play in our 
senior project competition may help us create a competitive team that can 
represent BYU in the smallsize league.</P>
<P>This document describes the rules of our competition for Winter Semester 
2004. Differences from the rules of the Robocup Smallsize league will be 
highlighted.</P>
<H3>The equipment</H3>
<P>Our competition will be held on the playing field located in the senior 
project room (498 CB). The field is green with white markings and is not to be 
modified by participants in any way. Unlike the Robocup fields, ours will 
continue to use the side ramps and side walls that keep the ball in play. The 
length of the field is 2900 mm and the width is 2400 mm. All walls will be 
painted black and the tops of the goals will be clear. No penalty markings will 
be painted on the field and standard Robocup rules regarding placement of the 
ball during penalties will not be followed. A standard orange golf ball will be 
used as the soccer ball. The ball is approximately 46 g in mass and 43 mm in 
diameter.</P>
<P>During competition, each team will have two dedicated workstations on which 
all their team and vision code must run. A single camera suspended over the 
field will be connected to one of the workstations to allow for image 
processing. Each team will be provided with a single wireless transmitter and 
two receivers to send commands from the workstation to your robots. Different 
types of RF hardware may not be used; each team must make sure they are 
operating on a unique frequency. During competition, only the two teams playing 
should have their transmitters turned on. Jamming of the other team's RF 
communications is prohibited.</P>
<P>Each team is responsible for the physical design and construction of their 
robots. A MagiccBoard for each robot will be provided to each team to provide 
control on board each robot. In addition, each team will be supplied with 6 
high-quality motors and 3 batteries. Other components may be selected from 
previously used equipment in 416 CB. (With recent expenditures to make the 
necessary MagiccBoards and to buy new smaller motors, we have little money left 
to reimburse you for any major purchases. In the interest of keeping the 
competition fair, please use the equipment provided whenever possible.) Low cost 
items such as wheels, wiring, connectors, and the vehicle chassis should be paid 
for by each team. Note that all hardware additions made by teams are turned over 
at the end of the semester for future Robot Soccer competitions.</P>
<P>Before a game, each of the two teams has a color assigned, namely yellow or 
blue. Each team must be able to use either yellow or blue markers. Circular 
markers of the assigned color must be mounted on top of the robots. The center 
of the marker must be located in the visual center of the robot when viewed from 
above. The markers must have a diameter of 40 mm. Robots may use black and white 
coloring on the top without restriction. Robots may also use green, pink and 
cyan markers. Only the colors provided by the TAs may be used in the 
construction of the tops. With the exception of the top of each robot, 
everything that is visible to the overhead camera (including the robot sides 
when on the edge of the field) must be black – i.e. no shiney metal.</P>
<P>Each robot must fit inside a 180 mm diameter cylinder; the maximum height is 
150 mm, including the colored markers on the top. At no time during competition 
can anything (e.g., a kicker, dribbler, or other moveable part) extend beyond 
this 180 mm limit.</P>
<H3>Competition format</H3>
<P>The final tournament will consist of a sequence of head-to-head matches or 
games. Each match will consist of two three-minute halves; the clock for each 
half will be stopped by the referee only for timeouts and in the event of 
something outside the normal scope of play (at the sole discretion of the 
referee). The clock will continue to run when goals are scored and when fouls 
are called. The halftime period separating the two periods of play will not 
exceed two minutes. Once a game is over, the teams playing the next match will 
have up to three minutes to prepare before their game begins.</P>
<P>Each team will have two timeouts per match, each lasting just 30 seconds. 
Timeouts can be called only when play is stopped after a goal, after a foul, or 
if the ball leaves the playing surface (assumed to be rare). During a timeout, 
robots may be touched and lifted by team members. Except during a timeout, 
robots may not be touched once play begins. Each team is limited to two members 
in the immediate vicinity of the playing field (even when play is stopped) to 
avoid congestion. (During play, everyone should move back to keep from 
obstructing the view of others.)</P>
<P>Just before each match begins, a coin toss decides which team is the home 
team. The home team then decides which end of the field they wish to defend, the 
color of marker that identifies their robots, and whether or not to kickoff at 
the start of the game. Before play begins, teams are responsible for ensuring 
that they are using different transmission frequencies. Unless both teams agree 
otherwise, teams will change directions and colors for the second half and the 
team that did not kickoff to start the game will kickoff to start the second 
half. </P>
<P>At the start of each half, the ball will be placed in the middle of the 
center circle. All robots must be on their own side of the field. Robots on 
defense can be no closer to 300 mm from the ball until it is touched by an 
offensive robots; robots on offense can be placed anywhere on their side of the 
field. Once placed, robots are free to move, but they must stay on their own 
side and cannot contact the ball until the referee signals the start of play. In 
an effort to make the competition format spectator-friendly, we need to stick to 
strict timing constraints. (The exact details will be worked out as needed.) 
Failure to place a robot in the allotted time may require your team to begin 
play without that robot on the field. Robots taken off the field for any reason 
may be placed on the field and resume play only during a stoppage of play: after 
a goal or after a foul has been called.</P>
<P>Once play begins, it continues (under normal circumstances) until a goal is 
scored, a foul is called, or time expires. To handle notification of goals and 
fouls, we will implement a simplified version of the Robocup Referee Box that 
will send your team code a message with the details. When you are notified that 
a goal has been scored, your robots must move (autonomously) back to your side 
of the field to prepare for the kickoff. (You'll know if you will be on offense 
or defense.) When you are notified that a foul has occurred, your robots must 
move themselves into position after the ball is placed by the referee. Failure 
to do so in a timely fashion may require the removal of the offending robot from 
the playing field, at the direction of the referee. A player removed in this way 
cannot reenter the field until there is a stoppage in play (typically a goal or 
a foul). Make sure your team responds appropriately to all referee box 
directives and does not contact the ball when positioning for kickoffs or 
penalty kicks.</P>
<P>In case of a goal, the referee will place the ball in the center of the field 
by hand; in case of a foul, the referee will place the ball for a penalty kick 
(wherever he deems appropriate). In either case, once the ball is placed, 
defensive robots must immediately move at least 300 mm from the ball. The clock 
continues to run, but play will not resume until signaled by the referee 
(through the referee box). On penalty kicks, offensive robots can move to any 
desired location. (No offsides penalties will be called in our competition at 
any point.) For simplicity, all penalty kicks will be considered <EM>direct 
kicks</EM>, allowing the robot taking the kick to score directly without another 
robot touching the ball. All referee calls concerning goals and fouls are final. 
Fouls will be called more aggressively in the goal box, but we will not be 
playing with a designated goalie on each team; Robocup rules pertaining to 
goalies will not be enforced.</P>
<P>With the walls on our soccer field, the ball should go out of play only 
rarely, so we will not implement Robocup's throw-ins, corner kicks, and goal 
kicks. Play will be stopped if the ball ever leaves the playing surface, in 
which case it will be placed back on the field in a neutral position (most 
likely near the center). If one team repeatedly causes the ball to leave the 
field of play (say because its robots have powerful kickers and poorly tuned 
control), fouls may be called at the sole discretion of the referee, including 
an arbitrary placement of the ball to resume play. Play may also be stopped 
briefly if the ball becomes stuck on the playing field in a way that neither 
team can make progress. The ball will be placed by the referee in a neutral 
location should this occur.</P>
<P>In matches ending in a tie after regulation where a winner must advance, the 
teams will play sudden-death overtime periods of 3 minutes until a goal is 
scored. Between each overtime period, there will be a short 90-second break.</P>
<H3>Playing rules</H3>Robots are not allowed to "carry" or "hold" the ball. The 
ball cannot be controlled in such a way that opponents cannot take it away. 
Nothing can be used to physically attach the ball to the robot (e.g., adhesive, 
suction). Concave openings in the perimeter of robots that allow unfair control 
of the ball are prohibited. According to Robocup rules, 80% of the ball must be 
visible from directly above and outside the convex hull of the robot; from any 
perspective (e.g., side view) 80% of the ball must be visible. 
<P>There will be no designated goalies in our competition, and Robocup rules 
pertaining to the goalie will not apply. (In a two-on-two competition it makes 
little sense to have a designated goalie.) We will not enforce the rules of 
unsporting behavior for robots on the field but not capable of moving.
<P>Soccer is a contact sport, and physical contact with other players is 
unavoidable, but we'd like to see a finesse game that focuses on individual 
skills and well-executed teamwork. Like Robocup, we emphasize the <EM>no-contact 
principle</EM> and encourage you to pay particular attention to obstacle 
avoidance algorithms that will allow you to avoid collisions with other robots. 
In particular, aggressive or uncontrolled movement that could result in damage 
to any robot or the playing field is unacceptable and inconsistent with the 
spirit of our competition. 
<P>Fouls will be called when "substantial contact" with an opponent occurs that 
is clearly the result of one robot's actions aggressive play or uncontrolled 
motion. Robots repeatedly committing such fouls may be carded and ejected. If 
aggressive or uncontrolled play causes damage to an opposing robot, the fouling 
team may be penalized by loss of match or (depending on the severity of the 
damage) disqualification from the entire tournament. Penalties and 
disqualifications will be accessed at the sole discretion of the referee.
<P>
<H3>Referee Box Commands</H3>
<P>Referee Commands will be issued to teams over a TCP/IP network connection. 
The score, the time remaining in the half, which half is being played, and an 
integer indicating the state of the referee will be sent every second. The 
following commands can be 
sent:<BR><BR><CODE>Halt<BR>TimeoutHomeTeam<BR>TimeoutAwayTeam<BR>FoulHomeTeam<BR>FoulAwayTeam<BR>GoalHomeTeam<BR>GoalAwayTeam<BR>KickoffHomeTeam<BR>KickoffAwayTeam<BR>Play</CODE></P>
<H4>Halt</H4>
<P>Whenever the <CODE>Halt</CODE> command is issued, the robots on both teams 
are required to cease movements. This command will always be issued before any 
of the other commands (with the exception of the <CODE>Play</CODE> command).</P>
<H4>TimeoutHomeTeam, TimeoutAwayTeam</H4>
<P>Timeouts can only be called after the ball is dead – i.e. when a foul is 
called or a goal is scored. This command will be issued after the 
<CODE>Halt</CODE> command. It will be followed by the appropriate goal or foul 
command depending on what stopped the match in the first place. 
<CODE>TimeoutHomeTeam</CODE> means that the home team has called a timeout. A 
timeout will stop the clock.</P>
<H4>FoulHomeTeam, FoulAwayTeam</H4>
<P><CODE>Foul</CODE> commands will be issued when the referee has determined 
that a foul has been committed. <CODE>FoulHomeTeam</CODE> means that the home 
team has committed the foul. The clock will not stop for fouls. A 
<CODE>Halt</CODE> command will be issued before the <CODE>Foul</CODE> command is 
sent. The <CODE>Foul</CODE> commands will not be sent until after the referee 
has placed the ball in the place to be kicked from. When the <CODE>Foul</CODE> 
command is sent, the robots should set up for a foul kick. The <CODE>Foul</CODE> 
commands will be followed by the <CODE>Play</CODE> command, at which time, the 
kicking team should kick the placed ball.</P>
<H4>GoalHomeTeam, GoalAwayTeam</H4>
<P>When a goal is scored, the <CODE>Halt</CODE> command will be sent to both 
teams. After the referee has placed the ball back in the center of the field, 
the appropriate <CODE>Goal</CODE> command will be sent. 
<CODE>GoalHomeTeam</CODE> means that the home team has scored a goal. The 
<CODE>Goal</CODE> commands should instruct the robots to set up for a kickoff 
where the team that has just been scored against is kicking off. The 
<CODE>Goal</CODE> commands will be followed by the <CODE>Play</CODE> command, 
indicating that the match should resume. The clock will not stop for a goal.</P>
<H4>KickoffHomeTeam, KickoffAwayTeam</H4>
<P>These commands will be issued at the start of the halves. 
<CODE>KickoffHomeTeam</CODE> indicates that the home team is to kickoff. The 
<CODE>Kickoff</CODE> command will be followed by the <CODE>Play</CODE> command, 
at which time the kickoff should occur.</P>
<H4>Play</H4>
<P>The only time the robots should be playing soccer is when the 
<CODE>Play</CODE> command is being sent. All other commands are setup commands 
and will be followed by this command.</P></BODY></HTML>
